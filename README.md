# Connect4.c
(Connect4 or 4Win) This project is a game developed in three versions, C, C++ &amp; Java SE, older to newer respect

This version is written in C Programing Language (MS Console) in 2009, it is my first project i wrote in my programming life :)

it was for my first semester project in uni

i was a beginner so please don't judge my programming standards.

i published it to give any junior programmer a dose of encouragement, self-trust & programming help to write a game.

Enjoy.
